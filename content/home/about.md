Hi! I am a first year PhD student in Finance and Economics at [Columbia Business School](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu). I am interested in exploring research questions at the intersection of Finance and Computer Science. Previously, I was a research fellow at [Adobe Research, Bangalore](https://research.adobe.com), where I worked on research projects in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Data Mining and Marketing.

I graduated from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in) in 2016. At IIT Kanpur, I worked on research projects in Machine Learning, Algorithmic Game Theory and Program Analysis. Check out my [publications](/#publications) for more information on my previous research.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, swimming, and playing football and squash. I also enjoy playing the guitar and listening to music.
